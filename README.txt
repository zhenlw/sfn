This is spaceFn implementation based on martin-stone's touchcursor.

The best dicussion I saw about spaceFn is this one: https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51069.0, actually it led me to martin's project.

The goal of this fork is to simplify the logic a little: 1) use standalone program only, 2) simplify the state machine, 3) perhaps remove form features too, for easier code reading.

Also will use some newer tools for building, like mingw and newer VC++.
